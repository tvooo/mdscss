# mdscss

> Base styles for Markdown-generated HTML

If you generate HTML from Markdown and have to control over the styles applied to individual elements, **mdscss** provides you with base styles to apply to a wrapper element.

You can also configure many variables or apply only part of the styles using the Sass mixins and variables.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install --save-dev mdscss
```
